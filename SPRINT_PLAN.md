## üö® DECISION POINT (Next 5 minutes):

**Choose your path:**

### Path A: Database Integration (Higher risk, higher reward)
- 20 min Supabase setup
- Full authentication working
- Real user data
- Complete platform demo

### Path B: Static Demo (Lower risk, guaranteed working demo)
- 10 min deployment
- UI/UX showcase
- Concept demonstration
- Focus on innovation story

**My recommendation: Path B if you want guaranteed working demo, Path A if you're confident with databases.**

Either way, you have an impressive platform to show! üöÄ
