## **REALTALK**

## Inspiration  
In an age where social platforms connect people more than ever, many still feel not truly *heard*.  
I wanted to create a place where people can share their raw thoughts, free from judgment, algorithms, and dopamine addiction.  
Thus, **Real Talk** was born: an anonymous, real-time conversation platform for anyone who just wants to be truly heard — without the fluff.

## What it does  
Real Talk allows users to participate in a live conversation board without profiles, likes, or filters. Just authentic talking.  
The platform supports real-time messaging, a simple interface, and optional guiding prompts to kickstart conversations when words momentarily fail.

## How we built it  
The frontend is built with **Bolt** and **React**, while **Supabase** handles the backend for authentication and data storage.  
Supabase's Auth and RLS ensure secure, anonymous login and access control.  
For real-time functionality, we rely on Bolt's rapid deployment and built-in components.

## Teamwork  
Real Talk is the result of close collaboration among team members, each contributing their expertise — from frontend development and backend architecture to UX design and project management.  
This collective effort enabled us to build and iterate quickly within the hackathon deadline.

## Challenges  
I personally ran into some headaches integrating Supabase with Bolt — especially around authentication and securing user input.  
The pressure was high, so I had to constantly balance speed with a clear, minimalistic user experience.

## Accomplishments  
I'm proud of:  
- Getting the basic system running within 24 hours  
- Securely integrating Supabase with a modern frontend  
- Designing a tool I would personally want to use

## What's next?  
Plans for Real Talk include:  
- Optional emotion tagging for posts  
- Lightweight moderation tools for safety  
- Improved mobile responsiveness and offline caching
